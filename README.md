# ELEC-8590

# Introduction
  - Programming assingments on developing CAD tools using Kernighan-Lin and Lee-Moore algorithms.
  - This repository consists of two directories: [KL_algorithm](https://github.com/12562/ELEC-8590/tree/master/KL_algorithm) and [Lee_Moore_Algorithm](https://github.com/12562/ELEC-8590/tree/master/Lee_Moore_algorithm)
  - These tools were developed as part of programming assignment for [ELEC-8950 Physical Design Automation](https://sites.google.com/view/mohammedaskhalid/teaching?authuser=0) course at [University of Windsor](@UWindsor) 

## Implementation:
   - Both KL algorithm and Lee Moore Algorithm have been implemented in C++ with dependency on the graphical library [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)
